# SecureAuth - Complete Authentication System

A comprehensive authentication system built with Next.js, featuring advanced security measures and user management capabilities using the next-auth library. This system is designed to provide a secure and prevent csrf attacks.

## Purpose: The aim of this project is to develop a robust authentication system using Next.js and next-auth library. The system will provide a secure and prevent csrf attacks. It is developed as a guide for developers to understand how to implement authentication in their Next.js applications.

## Introduction
This project is a Next.js application that provides a robust authentication system using the next-auth library and Next.js. It offers a range of features for user authentication, including email/password authentication, OAuth integration, and two-factor authentication.
There are only 3 ways to implement the authentication system in Next.js:
1. Credenitals Provider with JWT and CSRF Protection
2. OAuth Providers
3. Using SSO Providers
In this project, I have implemented the first two methods. The third method is not implemented in this project.
## Technologies Used
- Next.js - A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated applications.
- next-auth - A flexible authentication library for Next.js applications.
- Prisma ORM - An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for Node.js and TypeScript. It simplifies database interactions.
- PostgreSQL - A powerful open-source relational database system.
- Shadcn UI - A UI library for Next.js applications.
- Tailwind CSS - A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- Typescript - A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- Vercel (Deployment) - A cloud platform for deploying and hosting applications.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- A PostgreSQL database set up and running.
- A GitHub account (optional for OAuth integration).
- A Google account (optional for OAuth integration).
- A Vercel account (optional for deployment).

## Project Structure

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
